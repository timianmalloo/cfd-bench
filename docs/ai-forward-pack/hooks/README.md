# Hooks — the controls that run at the tool seam

Prose that says "check whether you already have it" is a memoir (`continuous-improvement.md` CI6). The
hooks here are the same rule as a **control**: a host runs them at a fixed lifecycle point regardless
of what the model decides.

| File | Host | Deploys to | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `reread-guard.py` | both | `docs/ai-forward-pack/hooks/reread-guard.py` | Counts identical reads per turn; on the third, and on any paged tool output viewed whole, adds a warning to the model's context. Warns, never blocks (a real third read exists). Fail-open on every error path. |
| `copilot.ai-forward-hooks.json` | Copilot CLI | `.github/hooks/ai-forward.json` | Copilot's hook config (`version: 1`, camelCase events, `bash`/`powershell` per platform, `timeoutSec`). Loaded from the repo automatically. Personal alternative: `~/.copilot/hooks/`. |
| `claude-code.settings.hooks.json` | Claude Code | merge into `.claude/settings.json` | The `hooks` object for `PreToolUse` (matcher `Read`) and `UserPromptSubmit`. Committed project settings run in sub-agents too. |

**Contracts these are written to** (established from the hosts' own documentation and a captured event
stream, not assumed — class RIG-D): Claude Code hooks receive `{"hook_event_name","session_id",
"tool_name","tool_input"}` on stdin, and exit 0 with `hookSpecificOutput.systemMessage` to warn (exit 2
would block). Copilot CLI hooks receive `{"sessionId","toolName","toolArgs"}` and return
`{"additionalContext": …}`; on `preToolUse` any non-zero exit other than 2 **denies** the call, so the
guard exits 0 on every path including its own failures.

**Windows:** the commands above say `python`; on Linux/macOS use `python3` (INSTALL §0). The Copilot
config carries both forms; edit the Claude Code command to the interpreter your machine has.

Measured origin: the profiled TheTerrace session viewed `public.html` four times in three minutes,
a 43 KB paged output whole twice, and one sub-agent read the same mockup six times — none of it errored.
